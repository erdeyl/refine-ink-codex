# Refine-Ink: Scientific Paper Review System

This project emulates Refine.ink's approach to AI-powered scientific paper review, producing top-journal-quality referee reports for social science papers.

## Quick Start

To review a paper: `/review path/to/paper.pdf`

## How It Works

The system uses parallelized multi-pass analysis with 12 specialized agents, each analyzing a different dimension of the paper. All analysis is grounded in the document text to prevent hallucination.

## Key Principles

1. **No hallucination**: Every claim must cite exact text from the paper. See @.claude/rules/no-hallucination.md
2. **Verbatim corrections**: Every error includes a specific fix. See @.claude/rules/review-standards.md
3. **Assertion-style titles**: Every finding title states a conclusion, not a vague label. See @.claude/rules/review-standards.md
4. **Design before results**: Evaluate research design validity BEFORE examining results to prevent anchoring bias. See @.claude/rules/review-standards.md
5. **Human-like prose**: Write as a senior reviewer at AER/QJE, not as an AI
6. **Confidence scores**: Every finding rated 0-100%, iterated if below thresholds
7. **Statistical awareness**: Be alert to common pitfalls, biases, and fallacies. See @.claude/rules/statistical-pitfalls.md
8. **Audit trail**: Every review produces a manifest.json for full traceability
9. **Read-only input**: Never modify the original paper files in `reviews/*/input/`

## Review Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Model |
|-------|---------|-------|
| math-logic | Equations, proofs, derivations | Sonnet |
